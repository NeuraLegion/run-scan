## Inputs

### `name`

**Required**. Scan name.

_Example:_ ```name: GitHub scan ${{ github.sha }}```

### `api_token`

**Required**. Your Nexploit API authorization token (key). You can generate it in the **Organization** section on [nexploit.app](https://nexploit.app/login). Find more information [here](https://kb.neuralegion.com/#/guide/np-web-ui/advanced-set-up/managing-org?id=managing-organization-apicli-authentication-tokens).

_Example:_ `--token ${{ secrets.NEXPLOIT_TOKEN }})`

### `restart_scan`

**Required**. ID of an existing scan to be restarted. You can get the scan ID in the Scans section on [nexploit.app](https://nexploit.app/login).

_Example:_ `restart_scan: ai3LG8DmVn9Rn1YeqCNRGQ)`

### `discovery_types`

**Required**. Array of discovery types. The following types are available:
* `archive` - uses an uploaded HAR-file for a scan
* `crawler` - uses a crawler to define the attack surface for a scan
* `oas` - uses an uploaded OpenAPI schema for a scan

_Example:_

```yml
discovery_types: |
  [ "crawler", "archive" ]
```

### `file_id`

**Required**. ID of a HAR-file you want to use for a scan.  You can get the ID of an uploaded HAR-file in the **Storage** section on [nexploit.app](https://nexploit.app/login).

_Example:_

```
FILE_ID=$(nexploit-cli archive:upload   \
--token ${{ secrets.NEXPLOIT_TOKEN }}   \
--discard true                          \
./example.har)
```

### `crawler_urls`

**Required**. Target URLs to be used by the crawler to define the attack surface.

_Example:_

```
crawler_urls: |
  [ "http://vulnerable-bank.com" ]
```

### `hosts_filter`

**Optional**. Allows selecting specific hosts for a scan. 

## Outputs

### `url`

Url of the resulting scan

## Usage Example

### Start a new scan with parameters

```yml
steps:
    - name: Start Nexploit Scan
      id: start
      uses: NeuraLegion/run-scan@v0.2
      with:
        api_token: ${{ secrets.NEXPLOIT_TOKEN }}
        name: GitHub scan ${{ github.sha }}
        discovery_types: |
          [ "crawler", "archive" ]
        crawler_urls: |
          [ "http://vulnerable-bank.com" ]
        file_id: LiYknMYSdbSZbqgMaC9Sj
        hosts_filter: |
          [ ]
    - name: Get the output scan url
      run: echo "The scan was started on ${{ steps.start.outputs.url }}"
```

#### Restart an existing scan

```yml
steps:
    - name: Start Nexploit Scan
      id: start
      uses: NeuraLegion/run-scan@v0.2
      with:
        api_token: ${{ secrets.NEXPLOIT_TOKEN }}
        name: GitHub scan ${{ github.sha }}
        restart_scan: ai3LG8DmVn9Rn1YeqCNRGQ
    - name: Get the output scan url
      run: echo "The scan was started on ${{ steps.start.outputs.url }}"
```
